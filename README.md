# Fast Food Fast

A simple web app for an online fast food restaurant aimed at providing a head start in full-stack web development. This project is still under heavy development. Feel free to snoop around, and do not hesistate to return a feedback should you have any suggestions. 

## Getting Started

Like I said before, this project is still under heavy development. The master branch only contains ui templates, all api endpoints and other web dev stuffs are handled on separate branches.

### Prerequisites

All you really need to run the ui templates is a functional browser and if you're reading this, then you have one. Yay!!!

## Tracking

Follow this project on pivotal https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/2194061

### Coding Style

Codes in this project are written in ^ES6 and incoporate several new features like promises and async functions and in the near future might also include generators. It also tries as much as possible to conform with Airbnb style guide. Be wary of running this template on legacy browsers.
